      <div id="para1" >
      <p> We digitally implemented a polyalphabetic variable substitution cipher in the style of the
      mechanical Enigma Machine. Our system uses the RS 232 protocol to receive, encode, and transmit ASCII characters
    ranging from hexadecimal codes x20-x7E. Selecting from a set of 857,375 initial conditions, the users send a plain text message
  from a terminal emulator over the serial interface and receive the cipher text in the termical. When the cipher
text is re-transmitted using the same initial condition, the plain text is the recoverd. With both the initial conditions and memory mapping
configuration kept as shared secrets between users of the cipher, potential advisories are faced with evaluating 10^500 message encoding configurations
in a brute force attack, well beyond computationally feasable</p>

     <p class="moredetail" > Health Recommender System, Modern Information Technologies (ENGS 112) </p>
<div id="p2" class="maincomp">
   <div class="outerdiv">
   <p> I built a recommender system that mines data from online open source resources to
     extract trends and help provide health recommendations. The use of health recommender systems have been
   on the rise due to the increase in data availabilty and mining techniques.Most of these systems uilize
   machine learning algorithms to assist end-users to determine diagnosis and preventive measures
for potential health risks. Most recommender systems primarily focus on patients as the end-user rather
than other players such as medical professionals and researchers. In this project, I tried a different approach
that focuses on policy-makers as end-users. This approach has potential to minimise cost, allocate resources
more  efficiently , and detect potential disease outbreaks through quantitative analysis of readily available health data.

   <div id="para3" >
   <p> This app allows users to see a schedule of each week's office hours. For each session, you'll see something like the following INSERT SOMETHING
     A user can join a queue where questions are posted. As the TA or Professor meets with these students and
     answers their questions, they are either removed from the queue or their answer is published to a list
      of questions that the TA/Professor feels might help other students as well. The queue allows everyone
       to view how crowded the office hours are, as well as manage long waits. It also makes sure nobody is
        left out, and by stating the topic/question the user would like to learn about ahead of time, people
        with the same question can be dealt with all in once rather than several times.App can be found at http://officehoursapp.surge.sh

     <p class="moredetail"> Huffman Coding, Problem Solving via Object Oriented Programming (COSC 10) </p>
<div id="p4" class="maincomp">
   <div class="outerdiv">
   <p> I implemented a Huffman code to compress and decompress files using tree data
      structures.  Huffman encoding gives the smallest possible fixed encoding of a file in which a  given
      letter is represented by the same code-word wherever it appears in the file. The algorithm I used had
      two parts: first, to construct a binary tree using a priority queue. then, to use the binary tree
      to generate the codewords. Each character in the binary tree is a leaf, and the path from the root
      to that character gives that character's codeword. Specifically, each edge is labelled with a 0 or 1,
      and edges going to a left child append a 0 to the codeword, with edges going to a right child
       appending a 1.

  <p class="detail"> Partners: Annie Yang, Daniel lee, Pranav Prasad</p>
<div id="p5" class="maincomp">
  <div id="imageP5"></div>
   <div id="para5" >
   <p> We studied the crystallization process of Ge and GeSn with the goal to optimize the
     crystallinity of the semiconductor thin film materials as well as develop a theoretical model for the
     crystallization process. The crystallization of Ge and GeSn thin films on amorphous layers is particularly
      interesting because of two reasons: (1) They can be applied to high quality photonic devices on Si to
      boost the speed and energy efficiency of on chip data links, and (2) They provide a
gateway towards cost effective, high efficiency tandem solar cells on glass substrates due to
the lattice matching of Ge and GeSn with many III-V semiconductor materials.

  <p class="detail"> Partners: Matthew West, Mackenzie Carson, Redal Ram </p>
<div id="p6" class="maincomp">
  <div id="imageP6"></div>
   <div id="para6" >
   <p> Caster wheels on shopping carts have a predisposition to flutter, which causes stress
for cart users. Thus, the wheel must be modified or redesigned to eliminate fluttering.
In th project, we created a spherical wheel to replace caster wheels on the front of
shopping carts. This wheel could eliminate flutter, reducing wear, and mobility difficulties.
